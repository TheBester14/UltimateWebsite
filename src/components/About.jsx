      <p>
        The ultimate website is a project developed by 3 first-year students.
        <br />
        The project has the goal to develop our skills as developers. Since we
        <br />
        are incorporating many systems which are new to us, the name "Ultimate
        <br />
        Website" was the most fitting.
